# A Social Media Alert System for Meme Stocks
Replication files for the paper: A Social Media Alert System for Meme Stocks.

**First step**: decompression of the zst files containing the raw Reddit data. To download the data, we rely on the project built by https://github.com/Watchful1/PushshiftDumps. 
The data are in zst format, use the code decompress_zst.py to extract the raw data in a csv format.
We plan to update the data and the model's results for 2024 soon, and to provide regular updates from 01-2025 onwards.
