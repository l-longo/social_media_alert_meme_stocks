# A Social Media Alert System for Meme Stocks
Replication files for the paper: A Social Media Alert System for Meme Stocks.

First step: decompression of the zst files containing the raw Reddit data. To download the data, we rely on the project built by https://github.com/Watchful1/PushshiftDumps. 

We plan to update the data and the model's results for \textbf{2024} soon, and to provide regular updates from 01-2025 onwards.
